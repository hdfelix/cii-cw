## Elementary

### Verses
“The heavens declare the glory of God, / And the expanse proclaims the work of His 
hands” (Psalm 19:1). 

### Focus
Creation shows us that God is great. In the universe there are billions of stars. Only a 
great Creator could make so many stars.

### Practical Application
Consider illustrating this point with pictures (or videos) of the sun, earth, planets, stars, and/or galaxies. Ask them if they can count all the stars in the night sky. Tell them each star is like the sun with many planets. Our sun is an average star like the ones we see in the night sky but there are millions upon millions of suns in the universe. Counting the stars in the universe is like trying to count the number of grains of sand at the beach. Impress upon them how great is our God who made so many stars.

## Intermediate

### Verses
“Indeed, My hand laid the foundations of the earth, / And My right hand spread out the heavens; / When I call to them, / They stand together” (Isaiah 48:13).

### Focus
Creation shows us that God is great. When we look up into the sky we see the sun during 
the day and the stars at night. Both the sun and the stars testify of God’s greatness.

### Practical Application

The ancient Egyptians worshipped yany different gods and goddesses such as the pplication. Ask children how big the sun is compared to the 
earth and how much energy the sun produces. Tell them a million earths could fit inside the sun 
(from pole to pole, the diameter of the earth is 7,900 miles). The sun is so hot it heats planets that
are millions of miles away. Find other details to impress upon the children how great God is to have 
made all these. Might also consider bringing physical objects to help the children conceive of the size difference between the earth and the sun, and thus the vastness of the universe sun god, moon god, river god, and earth god. The Egyptians believed that each god had their role to play in maintaining peace and harmony in Egypt. Today there are people who believe in other gods (perhaps provide some examples). Even though some people in the world worship different gods, none of these gods can see, hear, speak, or move. None of these are real gods. They are powerless and cannot do anything. The Bible refers to them as dumb idols. Only our God is the true and living God. He is the only One who is living and real. He is the Creator of the universe. He created the heavens, the earth, and all things, including you and me.

## Advanced

### Verses
“Who has measured the waters in the hollow of his hand, / Who has calculated the extent of the heavens with a handspan” (Isaiah 40:12).

### Focus
Creation shows us that God is great. When God created the universe, He not only
created our solar system. God in His greatness has created countless of solar 
systems and galaxies. Who could have created all of these? Only someone who is great! 

### Practical Application
See Elementary and Intermediate applications. Ask them about the solar system and galaxies. Explain that our solar system consists of the sun and planets. Each star you see in the night sky is like the sun with many planets. Stars are not scattered randomly through space, they are gathered together into vast groups known as galaxies. The sun belongs to a galaxy called the Milky Way. Astronomers estimate there are about 100 thousand million stars in the Milky Way 
alone. Outside that, there are millions upon millions of other galaxies also! To our great Creator, however, the Bible tells us that “the extent of the heavens” is merely the width of His hand. Only a great and awesome God could create a great and awesome universe.
