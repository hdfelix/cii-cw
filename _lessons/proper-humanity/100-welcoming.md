## Elementary
### Verses
"And when we had come to Jerusalem, the brothers welcomed us gladly."- _Acts 21:17_

### Focus
When people visit us we should welcome them gladly. 


### Practical Application
Consider the story in Acts 28:7. Sometimes your parents will invite people to your
house to visit. What is your attitude when people come to your house? Do you continue
playing or reading when they arrive? Do you hide? We should welcome people with a
friendly smile and say hello. Have the children talk about different ways they 
might welcome someone gladly and warmly. 

## Intermediate

### Verses
"And taking them aside, He withdrew privately into a city called Bethsaida. But the 
crowds found out and followed Him, and He welcomed them and spoke to them." - _Luke 9:10b-11_

### Focus
Sometimes people might visit us at an inconvenient time. We should welcome 
them and speak with them to show that we appreciate their visiting us.

### Practical Application
Tell the story in Luke 9:10-11 concerning how Jesus went away to be alone and
the crowds found Him. When the crowds found Him, Jesus did not speak to the 
crowds in an unfriendly way, but He welcomed them and spoke with them. What do you do 
if you and your friends are trying to play a game by yourselves and another child at your 
school finds you and wants to join in? Do you welcome him or her and speak in a friendly 
way? 

## Advanced

### Verses
"And both the Pharisees and the scribes murmured among themselves, saying, this 
man welcomes sinners and eats with them." - _Luke 15:2b_

### Focus
It might be easy for us to welcome people whom we like or who are like us. In the 
church we should welcome all people including those who are not like us. 

### Practical Application
 Ask the children to discuss what they think sinners look like. If a child from
 your school who is mean to other children comes to our childrenâ€™s meeting because 
 he or she wants to know God, we should welcome him or her. In the Bible, Jesus
 welcomed sinners and ate with them, and the apostle Paul remained two whole years
 in his own rented dwelling and welcomed all those who came to him (Acts 28:30).
