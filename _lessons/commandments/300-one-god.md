### Elementary
<br />
#### Verses
“I am Jehovah your God” (Exodus 20:2a). 
“You shall have no other gods before Me” (Exodus 20:3). 

#### Focus
The first commandment of God is that we should have no other gods. Our God is the only God.

#### Practical Application
Think of all the things your mom and dad do for you and give you for your
enjoyment (cook food for you, take you to school, give you hugs and kisses, take
you to fun places, etc.). If your parents want to spend some time with you, and
instead you tell them that you are busy or you just ask them to buy things for you,
how do you think they would feel? Similarly, God has done many wonderful things
for us. He created the air for us to breathe, food for us to eat, the world we live
in, and gave us life. How do you think God would feel if we don’t pray to Him or
come to the children’s meeting? God is the only God and His name is Jesus Christ.
No one else is God and we do not believe in any other gods and should not love
anything else above God.

### Intermediate
<br />

#### Verses
“I am Jehovah and there is no one else; Besides Me there is no God” (Isaiah 45:5a). 

#### Focus
The first commandment of God is that we should have no other gods. There are not many 
gods. There is only one true and living God. All the other gods are dumb idols. 

#### Practical Application
The ancient Egyptians worshipped many different gods and goddesses such as the 
sun god, moon god, river god, and earth god. The Egyptians believed that each god
had their role to play in maintaining peace and harmony in Egypt. Today there are
people who believe in other gods (perhaps provide some examples). Even though some
people in the world worship different gods, none of these gods can see, hear,
speak, or move. None of these are real gods. They are powerless and cannot do
anything. The Bible refers to them as dumb idols. Only our God is the true and
living God. He is the only One who is living and real. He is the Creator of the
universe. He created the heavens, the earth, and all things, including you and me.

### Advanced
<br />

#### Verses
“And there is salvation in no other, for neither is there another name under heaven given 
among men in which we must be saved” (Acts 4:12). 

#### Focus
The first commandment of God is that we should have no other gods. There is only one God 
and Savior, Jesus Christ. There are NOT many gods or many different ways of salvation. 

#### Practical Application
People may wrongly believe in different ways of salvation. For example, Buddhism
teaches that one can be saved through enlightenment, meditation, and hard work.
It may be helpful to discuss examples of other gods and supposed ways of salvation.
Although people may think that there are various ways to salvation, the Bible tells
us that there is only one God and Savior, Jesus Christ. Consider reading with the
children some verses about how salvation is only through Jesus Christ
(e.g., John 14:6; 1 John 5:11-13; John 3:16). If a child is touched by this 
particular point or by these verses, then the serving one may consider discussing
the topic of salvation more.
