Verse
“You shall not make for yourself an idol…” (Exodus 20:4a). 

Focus
The second commandment is that man should not make or bow down to any idols. 

Practical Application
An idol is a graven image, an object such as a statue, that is worshipped as a 
god or in place of God. We should not make any such statues and we should never 
worship any idols as a god or instead of God. Tell the story in Exodus 32 of the 
golden calf being worshipped by the children of Israel and how angry that made God, 
and Moses. Point out how terrible it is that after all that God had done to take
care of them, the people worshipped that golden calf and called it their god. 

### Intermediate

Verses
“You shall not make for yourself an idol…” (Exodus 20:4a). 
 “You shall not bow down to them, and you shall not serve them; for I, Jehovah your God, am a 
jealous God…” (Exodus 20:5a). 
 
Focus
The second commandment is that man should not make or bow down to any idols. Our God is 
jealous over us and He does not want us to serve or worship anything else but Him. 

Practical Application
The Bible tells us that God is jealous over us. To be jealous over us means that 
God loves us and wants us to love and worship only Him. He does not want anything 
to replace Him in our hearts. This is why we cannot worship idols, because they
replace God. Ask the children to consider how they would feel if someone that they
love and who loves them (for example, their parents) one day decided they were 
going to replace them with someone else and love that other person instead. How
would that make the children feel? That feeling of being replaced is how God
feels if we choose to worship something other than God because He is jealous over us. 

### Advanced
Verses
“For you shall not worship any other god; for Jehovah, whose name is Jealous, is a jealous God” 
(Exodus 34:14). 
 “For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the man Christ Jesus” (1 Timothy 2:5). 
Focus
The second commandment is that man should not make or bow down to any idols because God 
is jealous over us. God wants us to contact Him directly rather than “through” an idol. Any 
person or thing that replaces God in our worship of God can become an idol. 

Practical Application
All people were created with a desire to worship God, but some people worship idols 
because they do not know who God is or how to reach God. They may direct their 
worship to an idol thinking that the idol brings them close to God. For example,
some people may pray to a picture of God or hold a cross when they pray. But the
Bible tells us that God wants people to contact Him directly. We do not need any
idol, or any object or person, to contact God for us, or to “go between” us and
God. For example, your friend can speak to you directly if they need to tell you
something. They do not need to speak to a picture of you in order to talk to you 
or go through another friend to talk to you. This is the same way with God—we can
speak to God directly. We do not need to speak to an object or person or through
an object or person. Any object or person that “gets in the way” of our worshipping
God can become an idol to us.
