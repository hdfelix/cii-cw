## Elementary

### Verses 
"Whatever your hand finds to do, do with all your might...” - _[Ecclesiastes 9:10a]()_

### Focus
A hasty person is someone who does or makes things too quickly. Someone who is not hasty will do things at a proper speed with care and thoroughness.

### Practical Application
When you wash your hands, do you just wet it under the sink for a few seconds? A hasty person would do that. Someone who is not hasty would put soap on both hands, rub them well and then rinse thoroughly. Ask the children what it means to do things at a proper speed with care and thoroughness in matters like brushing their teeth, changing their clothes, etc.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"Do not be rash with your mouth, and let not your heart hastily utter anything before God..." - _[Ecclesiastes 5:2a]()_

### Focus
A hasty person is someone who does or says things too quickly. Someone who is not hasty will consider before they speak so they do not say something in a careless way.

### Practical Application
When you hear someone talking about you or saying something wrong about you, do you react right away or do you think calmly before you respond? When you are upset, do you immediately blurt out hurtful words? Someone who is hasty will do or say things quickly and carelessly without any thought whether they might offend others or not. Oftentimes, they regret what they have said or done. We should always consider before we do or say something and not react in a hasty way.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"The plans of the diligent lead only to plentifulness, / But everyone who is hasty comes only to want." -_[ Proverbs 21:5]()_

### Focus
A hasty person is someone who acts too quickly. Someone who is not hasty will do or say things carefully so as not to miss anything or make careless mistakes.

### Practical Application
Have you ever taken a quiz in haste and later realized that you missed answering the questions on the back page of the quiz? Have you ever done your homework hastily without first reading all the directions and didn’t get full credit because you didn’t answer the specific question? Someone who is not hasty will do things carefully and not miss anything or make unnecessary mistakes. When we do our homework, we should double check our answers to avoid careless mistakes. When we do any project, we should read the instructions carefully before we do the work.
