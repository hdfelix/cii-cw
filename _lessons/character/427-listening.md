## Elementary

### Verses 
"Making your ear attentive to wisdom" - _[Proverbs 2:2a](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24394&lvid=24394)_

### Focus
A person with a good character is one who can listen to others. It is important to be a careful listener when others are giving us instructions on how to do something.

### Practical Application
When the teacher is giving instructions on how to do a project in class, a good listener will pay attention and wait for the teacher to finish explaining before starting. They will listen to all the instructions even if they think they know what to do. They will also do their best to follow the instructions. It may be helpful to play a listening game which gives the children a series of instructions, such as “Simon Says” or “Draw what I say” to show the importance of listening.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, / But a wise man listens to counsel." - _[Proverbs 12:15](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24693&lvid=24693)_

### Focus
A person with a good character is one who can listen to others. It is important to be a good listener when others are teaching, correcting or coaching us. We need to be willing to listen to a rebuke.

### Practical Application
When your coach is explaining how to do a drill, do you listen and pay
attention? Or do you talk to your teammates or assume you know how to do it? Do you run the drill
exactly the way he requested? When your piano teacher corrects you on a certain piece of music, do
you listen and make the change? What if you did something wrong and your mother rebukes you?
How do you handle the rebuke? Do you justify your actions, insist that you are right, argue back, or
do you accept her words? A good listener is one who is willing to listen, follow, and consistently act
upon the instructions or corrections given to him. He is also able to listen to a rebuke without
arguing, getting upset, or making excuses.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"Whoever guards his mouth and his tongue / Keeps his soul from troubles." - _[Proverbs 21:23](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24966&lvid=24966)_

### Focus
A person with a good character is one who can listen to others. It is important to be a good listener when others are telling you something very important or when they are confiding in you.

### Practical Application
When your friend or parent is telling you something important, you should give them your undivided attention. You should not be distracted, be doing something, or paying attention to something else. You should not be trying to tell them something you want to say. A good listener does not interrupt others while they are talking, nor do they assume they know what others want to say. They listen, try to understand what others are saying, and wait for them to finish before speaking themselves.
