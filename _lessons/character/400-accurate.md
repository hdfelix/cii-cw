## Elementary 
### Verses
"Who serve the example and shadow of the heavenly things, even as Moses was divinely
instructed when he was about to complete the tabernacle; for, 'See,' He said,
'that you make all things according to the pattern that was shown to you in the mountain."- _Hebrews 8:5._

### Focus
An accurate person is someone who does things free from mistakes and errors.
It is important to be accurate in doing our school work. 

### Practical Application
Tell the story of Moses and how he received the pattern of the tabernacle and
had to be accurate to carry it out. Point out that had he not been accurate,
the tabernacle would not have been acceptable to God. Likewise, we need to be accurate
in what we do so that our work is acceptable to those who assigned it to us. 

## Intermediate

### Verses
"This man was instructed in the way of the Lord, and being fervent in spirit, he spoke and 
taught accurately the things concerning Jesus" - _Acts 18:25a._

### Focus
An accurate person is someone who does things free from mistakes and errors. It is 
important to be accurate when stating facts or giving a report. 

### Practical Application
Consider how the kings in the Old Testament had to hand copy their own book of
the law. Relate the story in 2 Kings 22. If the kings had been inaccurate,
King Josiah would not have known that they had not been obeying the law, and the people
would have continued to live without knowing what God wanted. 

## Advanced

### Verses
"A full and righteous weight you shall have, and a full and righteous measure you shall 
have, in order that your days may be extended upon the land which Jehovah your God is 
giving you" - _Deuteronomy 25:15._

### Focus
An accurate person is someone who does things free from mistakes and errors. It is 
important to be accurate when handling money or when you are being a witness. 

### Practical Application
If you purchase something at the store and the cashier gives you extra change, 
what would you do? We should be accurate and immediately return what is not ours. 
Others may inaccurately speak about God but we should accurately let others know
that God is real, that He loves us and cares for us. Another example: If you saw
something happen, such as an accident on the road or a classmate at school get injured,
you need to be accurate in your reporting of the details to ensure that the situation
is taken care of properly and someone is not wrongly accused or blamed for
something he/she did not do.
