## Elementary
### Verses 
"But let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no." - _[Matthew 5:37a](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=127&lvid=127)_

### Focus
A person with a strong character is someone who is able to do what is right no matter how hard it may be. They are strong to stay with the right choice rather than being pressured by others into changing their mind.

### Practical Application
Suppose you are at the playground and see some kids jump off the play structure when they are not supposed to. One of the kids says that it is so fun and asks you to try it. You know that this is not right and not safe. What would you do? A person with a strong character will do what is right and not be persuaded by what other people say to them. Discuss with the children some other examples of being strong and doing the right thing.

## Intermediate

### Verses
"For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power..." - _[2 Timothy 1:7a](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6672&lvid=6672)_

### Focus
A person with a strong character is someone who does not keep changing their mind after making a decision. They do not have a “jellyfish” will when making a choice.

### Practical Application
Suppose a friend invites several people to her house after school. You decide not to go because you have a school project that you have to finish, but then you find out that all your friends are going. Do you change your decision? Another example is in learning to play a musical instrument (or a sport or a new language, etc.). You found it very interesting and enjoyable at first, but after a while, it became harder and thus required more time and effort to learn and practice. Would you give up and quit, or would you stick to your decision and keep practicing? What would happen if you keep changing your mind every time you encounter difficulties? A person with a strong character will not keep changing their mind once they make a decision.

## Advanced

### Verses
"Only be strong and very courageous, being certain to do according to all the law which Moses My servant commanded you. Do not turn away from it to the right or to the left, that you may have success wherever you go." - _[Joshua 1:7](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=13817&lvid=13817)_

### Focus
A person with a strong character is able to keep standing for what is right against opposition and is able to continue towards the goal no matter how difficult the way. They learn to make a decision and to stick with it no matter what.

### Practical Application
Tell Bible stories of men like Joshua and Caleb who remained strong despite oppositions and hardships ([Numbers 13:25-14:10](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=12059&lvid=12077)), or Paul in his ministry journeys despite his afflictions and imprisonments ([Acts 13:4-28:31](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4222&lvid=4786); [2 Corinthians 11:23-28](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5868&lvid=5873)). Tell inspiring stories of spiritual men (e.g., William Tyndale – the first person to translate the Bible into English; James Hudson Taylor – missionary to China; David Livingstone – missionary to Africa, etc.), who after making a decision, were strong, determined, and never backed out despite poverty, long and disastrous voyages, oppositions, rejection, discrimination, martyrdom, etc.
