## Elementary
### Verses
"And be kind to one another, tenderhearted." - _Ephesians 4:32a_

### Focus
An affectionate person is someone who is caring and tenderhearted towards people. They are warm and friendly to be around.

### Practical Application
When you meet a friend or a child you do not know, you should always greet him/her with a smile and a “hi” and invite them to join you in what you are doing. It does not feel good to walk into a room where you do not know anyone and just have everyone stare at you without smiling or speaking to you. To be affectionate, we should warmly welcome people. Have the children demonstrate how they could affectionately greet someone.

Song: No one likes to be left out

## Intermediate

### Verses
“But whoever has the livelihood of the world and sees that his brother has need and shuts up his affections from him, how does the love of God abide in him?.” - _1 John 3:17_

### Focus
An affectionate person is someone who has sympathy towards people. When a person approaches them with a problem, they are understanding, caring and feel for that person’s situation.

### Practical Application
If your friend comes to you and says he/she is hurt because someone said or did something mean to them, you would try to understand how they are feeling and take care of them instead of just ignoring them. An affectionate person will take an interest in other’s feelings and situations, will show sympathy and concern for them, and do their best to console them. Have the children demonstrate how they would console a friend who has been hurt by someone’s words.

## Advanced

### Verses
"And finally be all of the same mind, sympathetic, loving the brothers, tenderhearted,
humble-minded." - _1 Peter 3:8_

### Focus
An affectionate person is someone who is caring, tenderhearted, and sympathetic towards people, but they are not loose in how they display their affection. They are approachable and express their care and concern for people in a proper way.

### Practical Application
If someone is hurt walking home from school, an affectionate person would stop to help and care for him in a gentle way or would help him get home to his parents, even if it makes that person late. If someone has lost something which is precious to him, an affectionate person would stop what they are doing to help that person look for what is lost. To be affectionate does not mean that you try to be overly helpful or that you give a lot of hugs to people. Rather, it is to show a gentle and caring concern for them.
