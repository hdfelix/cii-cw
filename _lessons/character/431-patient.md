## Elementary

### Verses 
"I waited patiently on Jehovah, / And He inclined to me..." - _[Psalm 40:1](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=22485&lvid=22485)_

### Focus
A patient person is one who is able to wait over a period of time. Patient people remain calm and do not become annoyed when waiting for a long time.

### Practical Application
When you are waiting for your mom/dad to get ready to take you somewhere, do you whine and complain and tell them to hurry up or do you patiently wait for them? A patient person is not easily annoyed or upset when waiting for others who take longer to complete a task. When you finish your meal and are asked to wait for others to finish before you leave the table, do you try to rush others by telling them to hurry and eat? Or do you wait calmly while others finish?

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"Better is patience of spirit than haughtiness of spirit." - _[Ecclesiastes 7:8b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=25396&lvid=25396)_

### Focus
A patient person is one who remains calm and does not become annoyed when dealing with problems or people. They understand that it takes time for problems to be solved or for people to learn.

### Practical Application
When trying to show a younger sibling or a friend how to do something, do you give
up trying if they do not get how to do it right away? When working on a long homework assignment, do
you want to quit after 10 minutes? A patient person does not get upset with people who take time to learn
something new and they do not quit when they realize that it is going to take a long time to finish their
assignment.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"What is my strength, that I should wait? / And what is my end, that I should be patient?" - _[Job
6:11](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=20948&lvid=20948)_

"Therefore be long-suffering.... Behold, the farmer eagerly awaits the precious fruit of the
earth, exercising long-suffering over it until it receives the early and late rain." - _[James 5:7](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=7217&lvid=7217)_

### Focus
A patient person is one who is able to wait over a period of time for results. They are neither hasty nor lazy in their work, but continue diligently without ever losing hope, allowing time to do its work.

### Practical Application
Explain to the children about the work of a farmer and how he sows seeds and works the ground, then has to patiently wait for months at a time for the fruit of his labor to be displayed, i.e., for his crops to begin to grow. It would be nonsensical for a farmer to try to rush his crops to grow by putting pressure on them and telling them to hurry up and grow. Life takes time to sprout forth from any seed and a farmer realizes this. Many things in life take time and we cannot expect instant results. When you take a test in the morning at school, do you expect your teacher to have it graded by the afternoon? When you try something for the first time (playing a different instrument or learning to paint), do you give up and lose hope just because you do not do it perfectly the first time? A patient person must work diligently and realize that results are frequently not instantaneous.
