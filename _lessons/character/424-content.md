## Elementary

### Verses 
"...being satisfied with the things which are at hand..." - _[Hebrews 13:5b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=7102&lvid=7102)_

### Focus
A content person is someone who is pleased and satisfied with the things they have. They are grateful for the things they have and do not demand more.

### Practical Application
Ask the children to consider the family, home, clothes, food, and toys they have and to consider what others may not have. Impress them that even though they may think they only have a few things, these may be much more than what another child has. They should be thankful for what they have and not always try to get more. Consider telling stories of children from poorer countries.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"But having food and covering, with these we will be content" - _[1 Timothy 6:8](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6652&lvid=6652)_

### Focus
A content person is someone who is pleased and satisfied with the things they have. They do not complain about the things which they do not have.

### Practical Application
sk the children how many pieces of a certain clothing they have (e.g. shoes, hats, etc.) or how many different kinds of toys they have or if they have their own room/space at home. Contrast how many other children do not have as much if even close to what they have. We need to be those who are thankful for what we have and not complain that we don’t have more of or the latest of something.
