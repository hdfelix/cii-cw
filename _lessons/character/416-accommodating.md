## Elementary
### Verses
"Let us make a little walled upper room and put a bed and a table and a chair and a lamp
for him.” - _2 Kings 4:10a_

### Focus
An accommodating person is someone who makes room for others. They make room for others to stay at their home and they make room to include others in activities.

### Practical Application
Suppose you are with other children coloring or eating a snack at a table and
another child comes to join you. To accommodate that person, you would make room
for him/her to sit next to you or move over in order to make plenty of room.
Sometimes your parents might have people come stay at your house and they might ask
you to give your room to them. If you are accommodating, you would not complain
about moving out of your room temporarily, but rather you would tidy your room and
have it look neat so that others may have a nice place to stay.

## Intermediate

### Verses
“Bear one another's burdens.” - _Galatians 6:2a_

### Focus
An accommodating person is someone who gives consideration to the requests and
needs of others. They understand that others may have different needs than them.

### Practical Application
You may be more athletic than another child and you are playing baseball. The game
only allows everyone 3 swings but if you know another child needs 5 swings you would
let him/her have the extra swings without complaining. You may want to eat your lunch
quickly and run off and play but you know your friend does not eat as fast and also
wants to play. To be accommodating to your friend, you would sit and wait patiently
until your friend finishes, then the two of you can go play together.

## Advanced

### Verses
"Be of the same mind toward one another, not setting your mind on the high things but
going along with the lowly; do not be wise in yourselves" - _Romans 12:16_

### Focus
An accommodating person is someone who is willing to adapt for others. They understand
that other people may have a different way of doing things or may have different needs.
They are also willing to accommodate for those who are younger or lowlier than them.

### Practical Application
You may be playing a game that is complicated and has a specific way to play.
However, a friend plays it another way or perhaps a younger sibling cannot play it
like you do. To be accommodating, you would go along with your friend by playing it
his/her way or change the rules to make it easier for a younger child to play.
Consider telling the gospel story of God accommodating man by coming down to our
level to care for our needs.
