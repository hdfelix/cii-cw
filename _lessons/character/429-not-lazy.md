## Elementary

### Verses 
"Go to the ant, you sluggard; / Consider its ways, and be wise." - _[ Proverbs 6:6](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24505&lvid=24505)_

### Focus
A lazy person is someone who does not like to work hard. Someone who is not lazy will always work hard and not take shortcuts.

### Practical Application
Do you always clean up your toys and put them in their proper place or do you just pile them all under your bed? Do you put your dirty clothes in the laundry bin or do you leave them on the floor? In the morning, do you get up and get ready right away or do you lie in bed expecting your parents to change your clothes and get you out of bed? A person who is not lazy will always work hard and not take shortcuts. Consider the ants (or the busy bees). They work hard every day for their entire colony. They prepare their food in summer and do not go hungry in winter.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"The sluggard buries his hand in the dish, / And will not even bring it back to his mouth." - _[ Proverbs 19:24](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24908&lvid=24908)_

### Focus
A lazy person is someone who does not like to work hard or to be active. Someone who is not lazy will not put off doing their work and will not escape from doing physical activities.

### Practical Application
Ask the children if they have any chores at home or in school. Do they always have to be told to make their beds, clean up their toys, help set the table, etc.? Someone who is not lazy will do their work right away and not find excuses to put it off or find a way out or have someone else do the work for them. Consider how farmers have to work hard physically, under the sun, day after day, year after year to till the ground, plant the seeds, water the seeds, pull out the weeds, and wait until they harvest their crops. There is no easy way out in the labor of a farmer. If they do not work hard, they will not have any harvest.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"Do not be slothful in zeal, but be burning in spirit, serving the Lord." - _[ Romans 12:11](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5112&lvid=5112)_

### Focus
A lazy person is someone who gives others the impression that they do not want to work or do an activity. Someone who is not lazy will be the first to get a job done and will exert their best effort in undertaking an activity without being told to do so.

### Practical Application
The children can accomplish a lot of things in a day. However, how much they do depend on whether they are lazy or not. At home, they can help their parents, take care of their younger siblings, do their homework right away, help with the dishes, etc. In school, they can help their teachers and classmates, pick up trash, clean the board, etc. For the meetings, they can help set up chairs, prepare snacks, help the little children with crafts, etc. A lazy person would find excuses and would not want to do any work. A person who is not lazy will be proactive in filling his hands and his time. He will take the initiative to do many things without being told and will do the job well.
