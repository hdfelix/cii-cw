## Elementary
### Verses
"Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work." - _[Titus 3:1](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6780&lvid=6780)_

### Focus
A submissive person is someone who obeys those in authority. They willingly do what is asked of them by those who have been placed over them.

### Practical Application
Who are the people God has placed over us in positions of authority? Parents, teachers, serving ones, coaches, leaders. A submissive person obeys those in authority, and they willingly do what is asked of them or assigned to them. At school, perhaps all of your friends are at a specific table, but the teacher asks you to sit at a different table. Maybe your parents have assigned each child in your family a particular chore. A submissive person accepts the arrangement willingly and does what is asked of them by their teacher and parents.

Suggested Song: Parents and teachers, leaders and the coach

## Intermediate

### Verses
“So then he who resists the authority opposes God's ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to
￼themselves.” - _[Romans 13:2](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5124&lvid=5124)_

### Focus
A submissive person obeys the will of someone who is in authority. They agree to do or accept something that they themselves would not ordinarily want or choose.

### Practical Application
Sometimes we are asked to do something and we really don’t mind doing it (like taking out the trash). But there may be some things that we really don’t want to do, or really dislike or feel strongly against. We would not choose to do those things. For example, maybe there is a certain position in soccer you try to avoid or get out of playing. What if your new coach says you have to play that position every game? How about when your parents say you need to stop doing something, but you want just “5 more minutes.” Do you negotiate for more time, talk back, or simply not comply? A submissive person accepts directions or decisions of those in authority, even if they would not ordinarily choose or agree with it. Also, they accept with a proper attitude, without arguing, grumbling, negotiating, or just ignoring it.

## Advanced

### Verses
"Let every person be subject to the authorities over him, for there is no authority except from God, and those
which exist are ordained by God." - _[Romans 13:1](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5123&lvid=5123)_

### Focus
A submissive person obeys the will and way of someone who is in authority. They agree to accept a way that they themselves may not otherwise choose.

### Practical Application
CAll authorities are appointed by God. We should obey those in authority because we are submitting to God’s authority. Therefore, when those in authority over us direct us in a way that may be different from what we would ordinarily choose for ourselves, a submissive person will agree or accept it. Perhaps your doctor prescribes some medication that you have to take 3 times a day for 10 days. After a day or two, you feel much better and don’t think you need to take any more of the medicine. A submissive person would accept the doctor’s prescribed way, even though they might prefer otherwise. Are there some things that your parents have chosen for you to do? How about learning an instrument or going to language school? You may not want to learn that particular instrument or language, or any instrument or language at all, but a submissive person would accept their parents’ plan for them. [For those who may be ready to receive the gospel, consider the following application: God’s word reveals that God has given man a specific way to receive His salvation through Jesus Christ. Some people may try to find other ways to be saved, such as being a nice person, or helping the poor, or doing good deeds. A submissive person would accept God’s way of salvation by receiving Jesus Christ.]
