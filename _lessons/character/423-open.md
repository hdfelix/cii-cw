## Elementary
### Verses 
"Hear instruction, and be wise; / And do not neglect it." - _[Proverbs 8:33](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24594&lvid=24594)_

### Focus
An open person is someone who is able to receive help from others.

### Practical Application
We need to be willing to let others show us how something should be done. If you are asked to make your bed and you try to pull up the blanket, but cannot get it straight, you should not get frustrated, but rather ask for someone in your family to show you how to make the bed correctly. It is always better to ask for help when you do not know how to do something than to get frustrated and give up.

## Intermediate

### Verses
"Listen to counsel, and receive instruction, / That you may be wise at the end of your days." - _[Proverbs 19:20](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24904&lvid=24904)_

### Focus
An open person is someone who is able to receive correction from others.

### Practical Application
We need to be willing to hear what others have to say and to be adjusted. When you are playing a sport or an instrument and your coach or teacher corrects you, you should not argue or try to convince that person that you are right and that you know what to do. You should be open and willing to receive correction and then correct your actions to show that you have heard, understand, and want to improve.

## Advanced

### Verses
"The way of a fool is right in his own eyes, / But a wise man listens to counsel.” - _[Proverbs 12:15](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=24693&lvid=24693)_

### Focus
An open person is someone who is able to admit to others that they need help in a particular matter or admit that certain things are bothering them.

### Practical Application
Suppose that at school, you were stuck on a math equation. You did not readily give up, and tried your best to solve it several times, but still you could not figure it out. Your teacher (or a classmate) came over and asked if you needed help. An open person would not be ashamed or embarrassed to get help when they needed it. Or suppose that something is bothering you. You need to be open to talk about what happened. Perhaps you said something mean to your close friend and she stopped talking to you. Inside you feel terrible about what you have done and it shows in your expression. Someone who cares about you (e.g., your parents or older sibling) may ask what is wrong. At that time we should open to them about what is troubling us, even admitting the wrong things we did or said. Another example: what if you saw some mean kids bullying a timid boy from your class? You want to help, but if you do, they might bully you as well. You know you have to do something but don’t know what or how. An open person will seek help from appropriate people like their parents and teachers, and present the matter in a proper, objective, and open way to get help for themselves and others.
