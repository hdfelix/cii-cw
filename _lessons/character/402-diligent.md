## Elementary
### Verses
"And let us not lose heart in doing what is good..."- _[Galatians 6:9a](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6053&lvid=6053)_ 

### Focus
A diligent person is someone who does what they are supposed to do when they are supposed to do it.

### Practical Application
Ask the children if they always feel like playing at the park? What about eating ice cream? How about brushing their teeth or cleaning up their toys? We may always want to do things we like to do, but not always feel like doing other things we do not like. But a diligent person will do what they are supposed to do when they are supposed to do it, even when they do not feel like it. When their parents tell them it is time to get dressed in the morning or that they have to tidy their room every day, a diligent person will do it because they are supposed to.

## Intermediate

### Verses
"Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting
straight the word of the truth." - _[2 Timothy 2:15](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6698&lvid=6698)_ 

### Focus
A diligent person is someone who takes care of doing things in a scheduled way to finish on time, not leaving things to the last minute. A diligent person will do their homework right after school and start assignments when they are given.

### Practical Application
Some books are hundreds of pages long and can take several weeks to read (bring in some to show the children). Some classical pieces of music are several pages long and can take months to learn to play. If you were assigned to read one of these books, or prepare one of these songs for a recital, you would need to begin preparing right away, and have a schedule to finish. What would happen if you waited until two days before the assignment was due to begin preparing? A diligent person does not wait until the last minute to work on something. They prepare an assignment when it is given and have a schedule to finish on time.

## Advanced

### Verses
"But we desire earnestly that each of you show the same diligence unto the
full assurance of our hope until the end." - _[Hebrews 6:11](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6911&lvid=6911)_

### Focus
A diligent person is someone who takes care of doing things in a scheduled way to finish on time and does the best job possible, not being hasty and not doing things second best.

### Practical Application
Children sometimes memorize their verses on the way to the meeting. Even if the children can do it, this is not as good as spending some time each day to memorize it. What if the children were given a month to memorize a book in the Bible? If they try to “cram” in all the memorization in the last few days, they may or may not be able to do it. Their recitation would likely not be as good as if they had scheduled out and practiced each day. A diligent person always gives their best in all that they do. They do not rush things, do a sloppy job, or wait until the last minute because that would not produce the best work. Another example: science fair project.
