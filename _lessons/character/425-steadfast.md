## Elementary

### Verses 
"...be steadfast, immovable..." - _[1 Corinthians 15:58b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5632&lvid=5632)_

### Focus
A steadfast person is one who continues doing something or trying to do something even though it is difficult.

### Practical Application
Have the children consider when they learned how to jump, skip, kick a ball, swim, ride a bike or write their name. When they first tried those things it may have appeared difficult but as they continued trying they eventually were able to do it. It is good to not give up when you are not able to do something the first time you try.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"By faith Noah, having been divinely instructed concerning things not yet seen and being moved by pious fear, prepared an ark for the salvation of his house..." - _[Hebrews 11:7a](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=7035&lvid=7035)_

### Focus
 steadfast person is one who continues doing something or trying to do something even though it is difficult. They realize that things of value cannot be obtained in a short time or by chance.

### Practical Application
Consider telling the story of Noah and how what he did was of great value to God. His building of the ark took decades and much persistence to work on it day after day. Others thought it made no sense to build an ark and made fun of him. With only his three sons to help him, he had to be steadfast and persevere to finish it.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"And let us not lose heart in doing what is good, for in the proper season we will reap if
we do not faint" - _[Galatians 6:9](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6053&lvid=6053)_

### Focus
 steadfast person is one who is loyal and devoted to their beliefs. They persist in what they believe in spite of opposition and discouragement.

### Practical Application
We are those who believe there is God. We may have friends who do not believe there is God or even make fun of us for believing in God, but as those who are steadfast we stand for what we believe in no matter what discouraging word others may say to us.
