## Elementary
### Verses
"Look therefore carefully how you walk, not as unwise, but as wise." - _[Ephesians 5:15](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6175&lvid=6175)_ 

### Focus
A strict person is someone who can obey rules without the help of others. We need to be strict with our behavior when we go to places without our parents.

### Practical Application
Speak to the children regarding how we ought to behave when invited to a friend’s house. Do we remember our manners and say “please” and “thank you” to the host? Do we share appropriately with our friend or do we assume that since we are the guest we should have extra privileges? Do we help tidy up before we leave or assume that our friend will clean up the mess for us? Do we behave as our parents taught us, even if they are not there?

## Intermediate

### Verses
"Guard your tongue from evil, / And your lips from speaking deceit." - _[Psalm 34:13](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=22360&lvid=22360)_

### Focus
A strict person is someone who can obey rules without the help of others. We need to be strict with our speech when we go to places without our parents.

### Practical Application
Speak to the children regarding how they speak when their parents are not
around. At school, children say all kinds of inappropriate things and we should not join in by
speaking inappropriately also. We know what type of things we should and should not say and we
need to be strict with ourselves even though sometimes it may be very difficult.

## Advanced

### Verses
"Redeeming the time, because the days are evil." - _[Ephesians 5:16](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6176&lvid=6176)_

### Focus
A strict person is someone who can behave in a proper way without the help of others. We need to be strict with regards to how we use our time.

### Practical Application
Touch the matters of being punctual and managing our time. Not only do we need to be strict regarding being on time to school, the meetings, or other events, but we also need to be strict with ourselves regarding our homework. We should schedule our time so that we have plenty of time to finish our homework every day. To this end, we should not spend too much time playing or eating snacks after school. We should also be careful not to waste our time on activities such as watching TV and playing video games. We should build up a habit of starting long-term assignments when they are assigned and work on them a bit each day, rather than waiting until the day before the due date to get started. A strict person spends their time wisely to take care of their homework and other responsibilities.
