## Elementary

### Verses 
"...to write them out for you in an orderly fashion." - _[Luke 1:3](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=1752&lvid=1752)_

### Focus
An orderly person is one who keeps things in a neat and tidy manner. He does not do things in a loose way but in the right order and arrangement.

### Practical Application
When asked to tidy your desk at school, do you clean out loose papers and broken pencils and crayons or do you push these items to the back so your teacher cannot see them? Are the things in your room kept clean, free from damage and stored in their proper places? Do you know where to find your things when you need them? An orderly person makes sure his belongings are well-kept and taken care of in a proper way.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"For you yourselves know how you ought to imitate us, because we were not disorderly among you." - _[2 Thessalonians 3:7](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6541&lvid=6541)_

### Focus
An orderly person is one who is well behaved when with others. His actions are peaceful and with restraint rather than wild.

### Practical Application
When given free time to play at school, do you run around crazily? Or do you maintain good order in your actions and interactions with others? You need to play and interact with others peacefully as it makes it so much more pleasant to play with a well-behaved person.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"...but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law." - _[Acts 21:24b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=4544&lvid=4544)_

### Focus
An orderly person is one who is observant of (willingly keeps) laws and obeys rules. They are law-abiding citizens and well behaved in society.

### Practical Application
When you go out to a restaurant with your family, you should always behave properly by maintaining good manners with the host and by keeping your voice down so as to not disturb others who are eating in the restaurant. You also need to be willing to keep the rules in society by always wearing your seatbelt in the car and by always wearing your helmet when riding your bicycle or skateboard. When you go somewhere and there are long lines do you try to cut to the front of the line or find another way to sneak in? An orderly person will stand in line and follow the directions of those organizing the event.
