## Elementary
### Verses 
"…If therefore your eye is single, your whole body will be full of light" - _[(Matthew 6:22b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=160&lvid=160)_

### Focus
A single-minded person is someone who is able to focus on one task at a time until it is completed. They do not try to do too many things at one time. 

### Practical Application
 Bring with you three soft balls for the children to toss. Ask one of the children to toss one ball to themselves for a few times. Then hand them the second ball and ask them to toss two balls at the same time. Finally, have them try to toss three balls at one time. Use this to illustrate that it is hard for us to do two or more things at one time. When we are doing our homework (or a 
chore) we cannot also be playing with a toy or reading a comic book. Our mind should focus on the task at hand until it is done. 

## Intermediate

### Verses
““…Your eyes are like doves.” - _[(Song of Solomon 1:15b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=25511&lvid=25511); cf. [Matthew 3:16](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=64&lvid=64), note 4:_ A dove’s eyes can see only one thing at a time. Hence, it signifies singleness in sight and purpose.

### Focus
A single-minded person is someone who is able to focus on one task at a time until it is completed. They maintain their concentration on a matter for as long as needed.

### Practical Application
Use the ball activity explained in the elementary level. Many times we are 
given a chore or a task (e.g., to practice an instrument) that takes time to do. We need to undertake the chore or task by focusing from the beginning until the end. We cannot switch halfway through our chore to do something else. We must be single-minded to complete the task without losing sight of the goal.

## Advanced

### Verses
"I have fought the good fight; I have finished the course; I have kept the faith” - _[2 Timothy 4:7](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6733&lvid=6733)_

### Focus
A single-minded person is someone who is able to focus on one task at a time until it is completed; they are not easily distracted. They learn to set a goal and focus their attention and effort until the goal is reached.

### Practical Application
 Use the ball activity explained in the elementary level. Some things are not 
accomplished in a short period of time. There are things, which might take months, a year or even years for us to finish. When doing these things we cannot change our mind back and forth. Our mind must stay focused on finishing what we set out to do. Someone who runs a marathon cannot get distracted during the race and stop for a hamburger. If someone wants to be an astronaut or a surgeon they need to study the right subjects at school for many years. They cannot keep changing their mind from year to year; rather they need to focus their attention and set their mind, no matter what challenges they may face.
