## Elementary
### Verses
"He who is slow to anger is of great understanding." - _Proverbs 14:29a_

### Focus
A calm person is someone who is quiet and peaceful in their emotions. A calm person does not get upset quickly or easily.

### Practical Application
Your teacher is ready to dismiss the class for the day, but your tablemate does not follow instructions and so your teacher makes your whole table wait, how do you react or feel inside? When your classmates don’t let you join in their games during recess, what is your attitude? Do you get angry, cry, and complain? What if you wanted a piece of candy and your mother tells you “no” because it is almost dinnertime? We need to be quiet and peaceful in our emotions. We should not get upset too quickly or easily.

## Intermediate

### Verses
“A tranquil heart is life to the flesh” - _Proverbs 14:30a_

### Focus
A calm person is someone who is quiet and peaceful in their mind and emotions. A calm person does not react quickly to things nor get overly excited or disappointed.

### Practical Application
When your parents point out mistakes in your homework, what is your reaction? Do you accept their comments and make the corrections or do you argue with them and get upset? How about when you lose something? Do you reflect on where you last saw it, where it could be, or do you immediately ask your mom to find it or blame someone else for it not being where you thought it would be? What if your basketball team is losing in a game and you are not making your shots or your teammate misses a big chance to score? Do you remain calm, or do you start to get frustrated? Perhaps you were promised to go somewhere and you have been waiting for weeks. On the day of the trip, the person taking you gets sick and had to cancel the trip. How do you react? We need to be calm and not react quickly to things or get overly excited or disappointed.

## Advanced

### Verses
"But he who has a hasty spirit exalts folly." - _Proverbs 14:29b_
"The simple man believes every word, / But the prudent man considers his steps." - _Proverbs
14:15b_

### Focus
A calm person is someone who is not easily excited in their thoughts and emotions. They do not react quickly to things, they do not believe rumors, and they have a calming effect on others.

### Practical Application
Consider telling the story of the twelve spies (Numbers 13 and 14) to illustrate the importance of being calm. Emphasize how the assembly was quick to react to the evil report and become excited in their thoughts and emotions. Compare that to Joshua and Caleb, who were calm, brought in a good report, and believed that God would help them succeed.
How do you respond to certain situations? When you hear something negative about a classmate or a teacher, what is your reaction? Do you quickly believe and follow the others? Or do you remain calm, consider the situation, and find out whether the rumor is true or not? What if your sibling accidentally falls and starts crying? Your mother who was not present asks what you did to make them cry. How do you respond? Do you explain calmly to her what had happened, or do you get angry and act defensively towards her? Sometimes when we consider things calmly instead of quickly reacting, we can affect others around us and diffuse the situation.
