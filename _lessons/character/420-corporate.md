## Elementary
### Verses "Love one another warmly in brotherly love; take the lead in showing honor one to another." - _[Romans 12:10](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5111&lvid=5111)_

### Focus
To be corporate is to be someone who is able to work with others. A corporate person is not one who is selfish, always wanting things done their way.

### Practical Application
If your family is deciding on where to go out for dinner, do you listen to all the suggestions or insist on your favorite restaurant? When you are in the children’s meeting, do you willingly sing the songs that others request or just your favorite ones? A corporate person is someone who can work with others and go along with their way. It may be helpful to bring some puzzles and ask the children to work together in teams. Some may work well with others; others may want to do the entire puzzle by themselves. Use this to illustrate what being corporate means.

## Intermediate

### Verses
“And the eye cannot say to the hand, I have no need of you; nor again the head to the feet, I have no need of you.” - _[1 Corinthians 12:21](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5511&lvid=5511)_

### Focus
To be corporate is to be someone who is able to work with others. A corporate person is not individualistic, someone who always wants to do things by themselves.

### Practical Application
Our body provides an excellent example of what it means to be corporate. No body part can be individualistic, acting on its own, but it must work with the other members in our body for us to function. For example, eating food requires our eyes to see, nose to smell, hands to handle, and mouth to eat, etc. Another example of being corporate is playing a team sport. This requires us to play with our team members, interact, and follow each other’s cues. We cannot be individualistic and just keep the ball to ourselves and not pass to others. It may be helpful to do some corporate activities to illustrate, e.g., playing ball or baking cookies together, etc.

## Advanced

### Verses
"That there would be no division in the body, but that the members would have the same care
for one another." - _[1 Corinthians 12:25](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5515&lvid=5515)_

### Focus
To be corporate is to be someone who is able to work with others. A corporate person is not reclusive, someone who withdraws from others to be by themselves. To be a corporate person requires not being selfish, individualistic, or reclusive.

### Practical Application
Suppose your science teacher assigns a group project. Since you are really good at science, do you complete it by yourself since it is faster or do you allow your group mates to participate and contribute to it? The human body also provides an excellent example of what it means to be corporate. Ask the children what they think is the most important organ in their body (e.g., brain, heart, etc.). No matter how great that part is, it cannot stand alone or survive by itself without the help of the other members. Ask the children what they think is the least important part of their body (e.g., appendix, tonsil, etc.). No matter how insignificant that part may seem, it can cause severe pain to the entire body if there is something wrong with it. Similarly, we should not separate ourselves from others, but work together with them.
