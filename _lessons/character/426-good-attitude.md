## Elementary

### Verses 
"Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus." - _[Philippians 2:5](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6252&lvid=6252)_

### Focus
To have a good attitude is to remain positive. Our words need to express a good attitude at all times.

### Practical Application
We can choose what our attitude will be toward a situation. We can choose to always have a good attitude and express it by speaking positive words. Even if we don’t like to or want to do something else, we should learn to say, “OK,” “Alright,” “That’s fine.” When your mother asks you to clean up your room, practice piano, or do your homework, even if you are in the middle of doing something, you should keep a positive attitude and respond with positive words. How about answering with, “Yes, mom,” or “No problem”? The tone of our words is also very important. Consider presenting the children with some “undesirable” tasks to practice their response.

## Intermediate

### Verses 
"...So then glorify God in your body." - _[1 Corinthians 6:20b](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=5343&lvid=5343)_

### Focus
To have a good attitude is to remain positive in all situations. Not only should our words express a good attitude, but our body language should also express a good attitude.

### Practical Application
Not only do our words convey our attitude, but our body language does as well. Our body gestures can convey our attitude, even without any words. When we roll our eyes, make a face, cross our arms, grunt or make whining noises, etc., all these convey a negative attitude or resistance on our part. Even if you say the rights words, a contrary body gesture will reveal your true attitude. If you say, “OK” to your mom, but make a face or place your hands on your hips, what are you really saying? If you receive disappointing news and slump on the chair and pout, what does that tell others? Discuss how our body gestures should be positive and support our positive words and attitude.

## Advanced

### Verses 
"Let your speech be always with grace, seasoned with salt, that you may know how you ought to answer each on." - _[Colossians 4:6](http://online.recoveryversion.org/bibleverses.asp?fvid=6404&lvid=6404)_

### Focus
To have a good attitude is to remain positive and be willing to go along with others in all situations. A person with a good attitude is willing to cooperate with others and support others even when things are not going well.

### Practical Application
It is a challenge to keep a positive attitude when things are not going our way. What if you get together with some friends and you really want to go swimming but they insist on doing something else? How about if you are on a soccer team and you are behind in the game because your teammate missed a perfect shot? What if you are looking forward to a family trip, but it gets cancelled last minute because your mom or dad has to work? How do you remain positive in these situations? If we learn to stay positive, we will have a much better experience through these types of situations. Our positive attitude, just like a negative one, can also influence others and how they feel and respond.
