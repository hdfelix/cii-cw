## Elementary
### Verses
"He who is faithful in the least is faithful also in much."- _Luke 16:10_ 

### Focus
A dependable person is someone who can be trusted to do what is needed.
They can be counted on to get things done.

### Practical Application
When a parent, relative, older sibling, or teacher asks you to do something, 
he or she expects that you would do it. For example, when your dad asks you to
feed your pet, he expects that you would give food to your pet. If you do not
feed your pet, your pet could get very sick. Your dad would not know that you
did not do it, so he would assume the pet is sick for another reason. If you are
a dependable person, others will ask you to do things because they know you
will get them done.

## Intermediate

### Verses
"For the word of Jehovah is right, And all His work is done in faithfulness." - _Psalm 33:4_ 

### Focus
A dependable person is someone who can be trusted to provide what is needed.
They can be counted on to bring what was assigned to them.

### Practical Application
There are many occasions in school where you will be placed in a group and will
be responsible to bring a certain item or perform a certain task. Suppose,
for example, a boy was placed in a group and the teacher assigned each person
to bring one ingredient to make cookies. If the boy did not bring his one item,
he would let the whole group down, because each item is crucial in making cookies.
No one can make the cookies if even one person “forgets” to bring his/her item. 
(Optional: make cookies for your “craft” today and show how each ingredient is
necessary in order to make delicious cookies.)

### Verses
"As for this house that you are building, if you walk in My statutes and execute My
ordinances and keep all My commandments by walking in them, then I will establish My
word with you, which I spoke to David your father; And I will dwell in the midst of the
children of Israel, and I will not forsake My people Israel." - _1 Kings 6:12-13_

"So Solomon built the house and finished it." - _1 Kings 6:14_

### Focus
A dependable person is someone who can be trusted to do or provide what is needed, no matter how difficult the circumstances.

### Practical Application
Once you commit to doing something, you must carry it out no matter how difficult
it may be or how much you don’t feel like doing it. Consider telling the story of
Solomon building the temple of God (1 Kings 6:1-38). There were undoubtedly days
during those seven years, when Solomon felt like the task was too difficult, 
but he knew he had to continue so that God could be satisfied and have a place
for His expression.
