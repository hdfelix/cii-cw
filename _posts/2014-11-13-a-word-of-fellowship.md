In the Fall of 2012 a group of saints serving in the church in Irvine began to labor on compiling lessons that would match the vision and burden presented in the book Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life.  This burden came out of some fellowship by the leading brothers to move our church practice into many districts. We also decided that each district should have their own children's meeting according to this view.

As we read and studied the fellowship in the book concerning the way to carry out the children's work in the church life, we made some adjustments to the way we had been taking. We decided to have only three levels: elementary, intermediate, and advanced. Then we began to prepare materials for these three levels accordingly.

In our prayer, fellowship, and coordination we were led to prepare lessons along several basic lines:

1. There is a God;  
2. The beauty and wonder of creation; and  
3. The preciousness of humanity, with aspects of character, and the law included.

We then began to compile materials that would assist us in carrying out this vision in our locality.

After some lessons were prepared and we were ready to have a new beginning in our children's work, we had some sessions to fellowship with the parents and train the serving ones to prepare and perfect them on how to give these lessons to the children. Formerly, the lessons we used were very full with a lot of information. Those lessons did not need very much prayer, fellowship, preparation, or coordination because so much information had been provided. According to Brother Lee's fellowship, he suggested a half a page of points was all that is needed. We adapted this style as we compiled our lessons. Therefore the serving ones needed some training on how to take these small lessons and make them into something they could use in the children's meeting.

After the training of the serving ones, we began our new way. It has now been over two years of serving in this way with the children and we are convinced that this is a good way to take. We've been enjoying some unexpected blessing in that our young people are much more active and useful in the children's work than ever before. The children themselves are much better cared for in a family atmosphere rather than in a Sunday School-type children's meeting.

These lessons were prepared to meet a local need according to the fellowship of the leading ones in the church in Irvine. Since we live in the Body, care for the Body and fellowship freely in the Body of Christ, we felt to open up our website to any who would like to benefit from our labor. However, we have no intention to promote these lessons, nor do we feel that they are the best. Also, we are not intending for all the churches to follow our pattern, nor do we think that this is "the way" and the other way is not good or correct. We were burdened to meet a local need.

We also would hope that if you do want to access these lessons for your church's use, you should also carefully read the [Introduction Section](/about) as well as the chapters (10-16) in the book [Raising Up the Next Generation for the Church Life](http://www.ministrybooks.org/books.cfm?id=3D5FD0CAC9FA) to become very familiar with the view that is presented there. If after using these lessons you would want to comment on them please do so. We would treasure any input from the saints and churches who access and use these lessons. They are still somewhat a "beta" test and need constant improving. May the Lord bless this labor and raise up the next generation of children in the churches to meet His need.
