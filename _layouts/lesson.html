      Note: The practical applications provided in the lesson are 
      offered as suggestions to help the saints in their preparation. They are not 
      meant to direct or limit the ways in which the focus of the lesson can be applied.
      The saints are encouraged to pray and contact the Lord to receive His burden
      and guidance in teaching and applying the lesson. Fellowship with other saints,
      and inquiring of the children themselves, may also bring out many helpful applications.
