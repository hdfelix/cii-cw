## Introduction
The children's work is to cultivate and nurture our next generation. It should not 
simply be babysitting in order for the saints to come to the meetings. It is also not 
merely a Sunday school work to educate our children like in a school. On the 
positive side, the children’s work aims to gain the neighborhood children with their 
families for the church. From these we can see that the children's work is greatly 
related to the growth of the church. 

### Our vision
The goal of the children's work is to build children up in their humanity to be proper 
human beings. Our emphasis is to cultivate a proper humanity in the children rather 
than teach them with premature knowledge. Gradually, we can convey to them a 
deep impression that there is a God in the universe, that man fell and committed 
sin, and that the Lord Jesus is our Savior. Eventually we can help them to receive the 
Lord and be saved in a definite way. 

###  Our Goal
person is the Lord's work. In whatever a person does, the most important thing is to 
have a heart. We must let God open our eyes to see the preciousness of the children 
and their importance in God's hands. When we see the importance and value of a 
certain matter, then spontaneously we have a heart for it. If you want to do this 
work, you must like the children, care for them, and be concerned about their 
affairs; this may be considered the minimum "capital" required for the children's 
work. 

### Our Person
When we speak of the children's work, we are referring to children who have not 
graduated from elementary school but are more than five years old. The place to 
carry out the children’s work should not be limited to Lord’s Day morning. A 
normal, proper and healthy children’s work begins in the home with their parents 
and family; it can also be carried out during the week in the homes and 
neighborhoods of the saints. 

### Our Scope
The lesson materials are not composed in full; they are simply guidelines. Saints 
who are burdened for the children should come together regularly to pray, 
fellowship and consider how to impart the key point(s) from the lesson. 

### Our Lessons
The lessons have been prepared for 3 age groups (levels): 

* (1) ELEMENTARY – 4-6 years old 
* (2) INTERMEDIATE – 7-9 years old 
* (3) ADVANCE – 10-12 years old 

The material for the elementary level should be entirely on the child's perspective. 
Bible stories are not necessary at this level. Gradually as we proceed to the 
intermediate and advanced levels, we can give the children a little more Bible 
knowledge. 
We should simply __impress the children with the facts in the Bible__ and give them a 
general knowledge of the truth __without giving them too much doctrine.__ For the 
children in the advanced group the gospel can be incorporated into the lesson, 
where and when appropriate. 
The goal of the lessons is that the children would learn: 1) To be deeply impressed 
that there is God and to know who God is, 2) to see God in creation, and 3) the 
preciousness of man (humanity) in God’s creation, showing that man is different 
from the animals, 4) what is proper humanity, 5) what is proper character, and, 6) to 
know the law (intermediate and advanced age group).

## CARING FOR THE CHILDREN ON LORD’S DAY IN THE DISTRICTS

### Nature
The entire time we spend with the children is important, not just the lesson. We are 
here to shepherd and nurture them to have a proper humanity and to create an 
atmosphere so that they would be attracted to the Lord and enjoy being with God’s 
people. 

### Care
The most important qualification of a serving one is to have a caring heart. How we 
are with the children, through the singing, craft, snacks, walk to the park, etc. is just 
as important as the lesson. The entire time with the children is an opportunity for 
the serving ones to infuse God’s love, to mold their character, to present a pattern 
of proper humanity, to deposit God’s word in them little by little, and to cultivate 
their heart to receive the Lord’s salvation in the future. 

### Family
Our children’s meeting should have a family atmosphere where you sit around the 
table or on the floor and talk in an informal way, with children of different age 
groups. The older children can help the younger ones in doing the crafts, in leading 
the hand motions of the songs, and serving the snack. 

### Not a School
Our children's meeting should not have the flavor of Sunday school (where there are 
grade levels and teachers and textbooks in a classroom setting). Not only should we 
not use Sunday school material; we should not even reference it. 

### Young People
We encourage the districts to use the young people as much as possible in the 
children’s work. The young people can even give the lesson to the children. One 
older saint with 2-3 young people could take care of 10 children. 

### Schedule
In some districts, the children might join the parents for the Lord’s Table meeting in 
its entirety or in part, and then have their own meeting afterwards. In other 
districts, the children’s meeting might be concurrent with the Lord’s Table and 
prophesying meeting. Here is a sample of a full meeting schedule as a reference: 

* 9:30am-9:45am Welcome activities (simple games or coloring) 
* 9:45-10:15am Songs 
* 10:15-10:35am Snack 
* 10:35-10:55am Lesson 
* 10:55-11:30am Play or activities 
* 11:30-Noon Craft 

### No Leaven
“A little leaven leavens the whole lump”. We should not bring anything related to 
Halloween, Christmas, Easter or Valentine’s Day into the children’s work. Not only 
should we not speak about these things with the children we should also not have 
any craft or snacks related to these holidays and festivals. 

### Safety
For the safety and welfare of the children, there must be at least 2 serving ones 
each week. Limit the physical contact with the children. 

### Discipline
To maintain order where all the kids can benefit, a serving one may take a child who 
is being disruptive away for a “timeout” if a child is not helped by a gentle 
admonition. Please view this as an opportunity to shepherd the child, instead of a 
harsh discipline. We want the children to have many happy memories of their time 
spent in the children’s meeting. If the child does not respond positively they should 
be taken to their parents.

### Report
A summary report should be written every week and sent out by email to all the 
serving saints for continuity and improvement in our care for the children. Parents 
should be informed of anything special that happened with their child or any 
concerns. 

### Kit
Each district should prepare a kit that includes the lesson materials, a compilation of 
songs, suggested crafts, a chart to record attendance and memory verses, some 
books and games (e.g. puzzles and blocks), and some simple prizes for the children 
who memorize their verses or for the older ones who brought their Bibles, etc. 

### Sixth Grade
In May each year the children in 6th grade will attend a conference in the mountains. 
The burden for the 6th grade conference is that all the children would be saved 
before entering Junior High. The majority of children will be saved before attending 
the conference. Therefore, the conference becomes an opportunity for those not 
saved to be saved and to confirm and strengthen the salvation experience for those 
who are already saved. It is NOT necessary for the 6th graders to have completed 
any particular set of lessons before attending the conference. On the Lord’s Day 
morning we will not have a special set of lessons for the 6th grade children. They will 
join the advanced age group for lessons. Whenever applicable the gospel can be 
included in the lessons given to the advanced age group. If some parents are 
burdened for their children to cover the lessons “God’s Full Salvation” previously 
given to the 6th graders, we would recommend that those parents have a children’s 
home meeting during the week where they can cover those lessons with their 
children.

## PREPARATION BEFORE THE CHILDREN’S MEETING

Introduction: The lesson materials were not prepared as detailed lesson plans but as a starting point for 
serving ones to fellowship and develop. Each lesson needs to be developed in a way that can be applied 
to the children in your district. Every week the serving ones need to meet together for at least thirty 
(30) minutes to:

* Pray together for the children and the children’s meeting time. 
* Fellowship about the children (condition, behavior, special needs, capacity). 
* Meet with the serving ones from the previous Lord’s Day to fellowship what occurred during 
the children’s meeting that day. 
* Read and pray over the verses and lesson material. (Read all three levels and review the 
previous levels for intermediate and advanced groups, if applicable.) 
* Fellowship about how to apply the lesson. Consider your audience and use appropriate 
examples or stories to help the children understand the lesson. It is good to use real life 
examples that relate to the children. It may not be necessary to use a bible story every 
week. 
* Select songs – they do not need to relate to the lesson but should be age appropriate. 
* Prepare crafts. 
* Prepare snacks – no sugary snacks or major allergy offenders like peanuts or juices or snacks 
with food dyes, etc. Cut up fruits with water are always good options. 
* Plan some activities and games.

## PRESENTATION OF THE LESSON 
Introduction: It is not necessary to have different age groups in separate classrooms but it is necessary to give the lesson to different age groups separately or at different times. One group of children might do the craft or play while another group of children gets their lesson.

* It is better for the lesson to be short than long. The following are suggested lengths for the lessons: Elementary – 10 minutes, Intermediate – 15 minutes, Advanced – 20 minutes. 6 
* When giving the lesson be personal, interesting, and informal. Consider how to give the lesson without the classroom format (e.g. while taking a nature walk, while eating a snack). Do your best to engage the children. Make the lesson interactive where children are able to answer questions or express their thoughts. 
* We should present the lessons in a very practical way, using many illustrations, examples and testimonies that are applicable to their daily life. Visuals can also help especially with the younger kids. Some useful visual aids are: white boards, pictures, and objects related to the lesson. Skits or plays should not be used to give a lesson. 
* Stories, especially real life stories, are an excellent way to convey the lesson. Serving ones are encouraged to include a story, even one from their own experience, in the lesson. Please be careful not to tell a story which is a fairytale, fable or folklore or that includes: dragons, sorcery, or themes related to Christmas, Easter, Valentine’s Day or Halloween. 
* It is important to bear in mind that the Lord has His own timing for each child’s personal experience of Him as their Savior and life. Our burden is to build them up, primarily in their humanity, to be proper human beings and by gradually depositing the Word into the children’s heart, the Lord, in His timing, could touch their conscience. We should keep sowing the Word each week until we see the Spirit convicting their hearts. We must not be too quick to lead them to salvation or to teach them about spiritual life experiences and life practices. We should wait until they are ready. To give anything prematurely to the children could spoil their personal experience of the Lord’s salvation and damage them. 
* We should not give the children premature knowledge about the subjective experiences of life. For example, we should not tell the children about bearing the cross, dealing with the self, or that they need to follow the sense of life. 
* We should not give the children too much doctrines or teachings. Some examples of too much doctrine are 1) to give them the spiritual interpretations of the father, son, robe, ring, fatted calf when telling them the story of the prodigal son in Luke 15, and 2) to tell them God is our rock because most children will understand that literally. 
* We should not give the children religious concepts and thoughts. For example, God loves the good people and is angry with the bad people; or that people go to heaven when they die. 
* We should avoid emphasizing the exercise of their spirit using life practices (e.g. calling on the Lord, pray-reading His word) until the children are regenerated, scaring them with details about God’s judgment and the lake of fire, and bringing up holidays and festivals that are earthly and even pagan (e.g. Christmas, Easter, Halloween and Valentine’s Day).

## QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DISTRICTING AND THE CHILDREN

__What do we do if there are only 1 or 2 children in our district?__

If the children are young it would be best to see if you can care for them in your district. Ifthe children are older and/or need to be with some other children we would recommend that 2 districts combine their children’s meeting on the Lord’s Day. 

__How will the children in our district see the other children in the church?__

There will be opportunities throughout the year for the children to see children in the other districts. Every two months each district will blend with another district at Hall 1. The whole church will also meet together twice a year, once in the fall and once in the spring. During the summer the children will be together for the Summer Bible Camp. It is also possible that during the year we could arrange special events (picnic) for the children to be together. These special events will depend upon the burden of the parents to help with the arrangements. 

__What if the children are different ages (in different grades)?__

In a family it is an exception to have children of the same age. Our view for the children’s meeting on the Lord’s Day is that the atmosphere would be like that of a family rather than a school. The younger and older children can be together with the older children helping to care for the younger children. The serving ones would be like an older brother or sister (young people and college students) or an uncle or aunt. We also hope that the children could invite their friends from school to join the children’s meeting. 

__Who will serve?__

Saints who have both a heart for and a way with the children would be encouraged to serve. The young people can be a great help in carrying out the children’s meeting and should be encouraged to lead the singing, give the lesson, and provide the craft or activity ideas. 

__What lessons and material will we use?__

The church has prepared a new series of lessons for the districts to use. The lessons focus more on presenting a pattern of proper humanity than bible stories and truths. Therefore, it is not necessary that the serving ones be “good teachers” with extensive knowledge of the Bible. Along with the lessons there will also be songs (with audio files), craft and activities ideas, and a supply kit for the districts to use. The districts should not introduce their own material for the children’s meeting.
